## What does Rudim do?

Rudim is a relatively simple engine (at the moment) trying to keep things simple and modular, to try to build the perfect bridge between a "strong" and an "easy to understand" chess engine.

Rudim has been hosted on lichess, you can [play with Rudim on Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/rudim-bot).  


### What all does Rudim implement?

- Bitboards & Magics
- UCI Protocol (WIP - core functionality only)
- Piece Square Tables & Material Evaluation ( + Tapered )
- Iterative Deepening on Negamax (with Alpha Beta Pruning & PVS) & Quiescence Search
- Move Ordering with Hash Move, MVV LVA, Killer Heuristic, History Heuristic
- Transposition Tables using Zobrist Hashing

### What's next for Rudim?

- Finish the implementation for the UCI commands (and any changes in the implementation for Rudim that might be a result of it)
- Improve the Search, Move Generation, and Evaluation algorithms to make Rudim stronger.

## How does Rudim work?
