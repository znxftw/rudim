## What does Rudim do?

Rudim is currently a work in progress but is in an MVP phase - you can [play with Rudim on Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/rudim-bot).  

If you see Rudim as offline - the server might be down. If Rudim is online but not accepting your challenge, Rudim might either be playing someone else (currently can play only one person at a time) or the server might be restarting - try again later.

### What all does Rudim implement?

- Bitboards & Magic Bitboards
- UCI Protocol (Partial)
- Simplified Evaluation (Piece Square Tables)
- Tapered Evaluation
- Iterative Deepening + Negamax with Alpha Beta Pruning
- Quiescent Search
- Move Ordering - MVV LVA, Killer Heuristic

### What's next for Rudim?

- Finish the implementation for the UCI commands (and any changes in the implementation for Rudim that might be a result of it)
- Improve the Search, Move Generation, and Evaluation algorithms to make Rudim stronger.
